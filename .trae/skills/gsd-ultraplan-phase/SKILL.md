<objective>
Offload GSD's plan phase to Trae's ultraplan cloud infrastructure.

Ultraplan drafts the plan in a remote cloud session while your terminal stays free.
Review and comment on the plan in your browser, then import it back via /gsd-import --from.

⚠ BETA: ultraplan is in research preview. Use /gsd-plan-phase for stable local planning.
Requirements: Trae v2.1.91+, claude.ai account, GitHub repository.
